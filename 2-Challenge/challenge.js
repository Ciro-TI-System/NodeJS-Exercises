/*Create two javascript files;
  *The first one will export a function called getFlagValue() which will receive a string argument;
  *This function should search inside the 'process.argv' array for the desired flag, which is a String and return the flag's value;
  *The second will import the function and pass the desired flag.
  *We will run the second file in the terminal, passing the flags '--name' and '--greeting' so that the greeting and name of the person are printed in the terminal.
